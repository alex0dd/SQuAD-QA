       " '5_20': 'chopin seldom performed publicly in paris. in later years he generally gave a single annual concert at the salle pleyel, a venue that seated three hundred. he played more frequently at salons, but preferred playing at his own paris apartment for small groups of friends. the musicologist arthur hedley has observed that \" as a pianist chopin was unique in acquiring a reputation of the highest order on the basis of a minimum of public appearances — few more than thirty in the course of his lifetime. \" the list of musicians who took part in some of his concerts provides an indication of the richness of parisian artistic life during this period. examples include a concert on 23 march 1833, in which chopin, liszt and hiller performed ( on pianos ) a concerto by j. s. bach for three keyboards ; and, on 3 march 1838, a concert in which chopin, his pupil adolphe gutmann, charles - valentin alkan, and alkan\\'s teacher joseph zimmermann performed alkan\\'s arrangement, for eight hands, of two movements from beethoven\\'s 7th symphony. chopin was also involved in the composition of liszt\\'s hexameron ; he wrote the sixth ( and final ) variation on bellini\\'s theme. chopin\\'s music soon found success with publishers, and in 1833 he contracted with maurice schlesinger, who arranged for it to be published not only in france but, through his family connections, also in germany and england.',\n",

       " '5_23': \"the two became friends, and for many years lived in close proximity in paris, chopin at 38 rue de la chaussee - d'antin, and liszt at the hotel de france on the rue lafitte, a few blocks away. they performed together on seven occasions between 1833 and 1841. the first, on 2 april 1833, was at a benefit concert organized by hector berlioz for his bankrupt shakespearean actress wife harriet smithson, during which they played george onslow's sonata in f minor for piano duet. later joint appearances included a benefit concert for the benevolent association of polish ladies in paris. their last appearance together in public was for a charity concert conducted for the beethoven memorial in bonn, held at the salle pleyel and the paris conservatory on 25 and 26 april 1841.\",\n",
       " '5_24': 'although the two displayed great respect and admiration for each other, their friendship was uneasy and had some qualities of a love - hate relationship. harold c. schonberg believes that chopin displayed a \" tinge of jealousy and spite \" towards liszt\\'s virtuosity on the piano, and others have also argued that he had become enchanted with liszt\\'s theatricality, showmanship and success. liszt was the dedicatee of chopin\\'s op. 10 etudes, and his performance of them prompted the composer to write to hiller, \" i should like to rob him of the way he plays my studies. \" however, chopin expressed annoyance in 1843 when liszt performed one of his nocturnes with the addition of numerous intricate embellishments, at which chopin remarked that he should play the music as written or not play it at all, forcing an apology. most biographers of chopin state that after this the two had little to do with each other, although in his letters dated as late as 1848 he still referred to him as \" my friend liszt \". some commentators point to events in the two men\\'s romantic lives which led to a rift between them ; there are claims that liszt had displayed jealousy of his mistress marie d\\'agoult\\'s obsession with chopin, while others believe that chopin had become concerned about liszt\\'s growing relationship with george sand.',\n",

       " '5_26': 'in june 1837 chopin visited london incognito in the company of the piano manufacturer camille pleyel where he played at a musical soiree at the house of english piano maker james broadwood. on his return to paris, his association with sand began in earnest, and by the end of june 1838 they had become lovers. sand, who was six years older than the composer, and who had had a series of lovers, wrote at this time : \" i must say i was confused and amazed at the effect this little creature had on me... i have still not recovered from my astonishment, and if i were a proud person i should be feeling humiliated at having been carried away... \" the two spent a miserable winter on majorca ( 8 november 1838 to 13 february 1839 ), where, together with sand\\'s two children, they had journeyed in the hope of improving the health of chopin and that of sand\\'s 15 - year - old son maurice, and also to escape the threats of sand\\'s former lover felicien mallefille. after discovering that the couple were not married, the deeply traditional catholic people of majorca became inhospitable, making accommodation difficult to find. this compelled the group to take lodgings in a former carthusian monastery in valldemossa, which gave little shelter from the cold winter weather.',\n",
       " '5_27': 'on 3 december, chopin complained about his bad health and the incompetence of the doctors in majorca : \" three doctors have visited me... the first said i was dead ; the second said i was dying ; and the third said i was about to die. \" he also had problems having his pleyel piano sent to him. it finally arrived from paris in december. chopin wrote to pleyel in january 1839 : \" i am sending you my preludes [ ( op. 28 ) ]. i finished them on your little piano, which arrived in the best possible condition in spite of the sea, the bad weather and the palma customs. \" chopin was also able to undertake work on his ballade no. 2, op. 38 ; two polonaises, op. 40 ; and the scherzo no. 3, op. 39.',\n",
       " '5_28': \"although this period had been productive, the bad weather had such a detrimental effect on chopin's health that sand determined to leave the island. to avoid further customs duties, sand sold the piano to a local french couple, the canuts. [ n 8 ] the group traveled first to barcelona, then to marseilles, where they stayed for a few months while chopin convalesced. in may 1839 they headed for the summer to sand's estate at nohant, where they spent most summers until 1846. in autumn they returned to paris, where chopin's apartment at 5 rue tronchet was close to sand's rented accommodation at the rue pigalle. he frequently visited sand in the evenings, but both retained some independence. in 1842 he and sand moved to the square d'orleans, living in adjacent buildings.\",\n",
       " '5_29': \"at the funeral of the tenor adolphe nourrit in paris in 1839, chopin made a rare appearance at the organ, playing a transcription of franz schubert's lied die gestirne. on 26 july 1840 chopin and sand were present at the dress rehearsal of berlioz's grande symphonie funebre et triomphale, composed to commemorate the tenth anniversary of the july revolution. chopin was reportedly unimpressed with the composition.\",\n",
       " '5_30': 'during the summers at nohant, particularly in the years 1839 – 43, chopin found quiet, productive days during which he composed many works, including his polonaise in a - flat major, op. 53. among the visitors to nohant were delacroix and the mezzo - soprano pauline viardot, whom chopin had advised on piano technique and composition. delacroix gives an account of staying at nohant in a letter of 7 june 1842 :',\n",
       " '5_31': 'from 1842 onwards, chopin showed signs of serious illness. after a solo recital in paris on 21 february 1842, he wrote to grzymała : \" i have to lie in bed all day long, my mouth and tonsils are aching so much. \" he was forced by illness to decline a written invitation from alkan to participate in a repeat performance of the beethoven seventh symphony arrangement at erard\\'s on 1 march 1843. late in 1844, charles halle visited chopin and found him \" hardly able to move, bent like a half - opened penknife and evidently in great pain \", although his spirits returned when he started to play the piano for his visitor. chopin\\'s health continued to deteriorate, particularly from this time onwards. modern research suggests that apart from any other illnesses, he may also have suffered from temporal lobe epilepsy.',\n",
       " '5_32': 'chopin\\'s relations with sand were soured in 1846 by problems involving her daughter solange and solange\\'s fiance, the young fortune - hunting sculptor auguste clesinger. the composer frequently took solange\\'s side in quarrels with her mother ; he also faced jealousy from sand\\'s son maurice. chopin was utterly indifferent to sand\\'s radical political pursuits, while sand looked on his society friends with disdain. as the composer\\'s illness progressed, sand had become less of a lover and more of a nurse to chopin, whom she called her \" third child \". in letters to third parties, she vented her impatience, referring to him as a \" child, \" a \" little angel \", a \" sufferer \" and a \" beloved little corpse. \" in 1847 sand published her novel lucrezia floriani, whose main characters — a rich actress and a prince in weak health — could be interpreted as sand and chopin ; the story was uncomplimentary to chopin, who could not have missed the allusions as he helped sand correct the printer\\'s galleys. in 1847 he did not visit nohant, and he quietly ended their ten - year relationship following an angry correspondence which, in sand\\'s words, made \" a strange conclusion to nine years of exclusive friendship. \" the two would never meet again.',\n",
       " '5_33': 'chopin\\'s output as a composer throughout this period declined in quantity year by year. whereas in 1841 he had written a dozen works, only six were written in 1842 and six shorter pieces in 1843. in 1844 he wrote only the op. 58 sonata. 1845 saw the completion of three mazurkas ( op. 59 ). although these works were more refined than many of his earlier compositions, zamoyski opines that \" his powers of concentration were failing and his inspiration was beset by anguish, both emotional and intellectual. \"',\n",
       " '5_34': \"chopin's public popularity as a virtuoso began to wane, as did the number of his pupils, and this, together with the political strife and instability of the time, caused him to struggle financially. in february 1848, with the cellist auguste franchomme, he gave his last paris concert, which included three movements of the cello sonata op. 65.\",\n",

       " '5_55': 'chopin was educated in the tradition of beethoven, haydn, mozart and clementi ; he used clementi\\'s piano method with his own students. he was also influenced by hummel\\'s development of virtuoso, yet mozartian, piano technique. he cited bach and mozart as the two most important composers in shaping his musical outlook. chopin\\'s early works are in the style of the \" brilliant \" keyboard pieces of his era as exemplified by the works of ignaz moscheles, friedrich kalkbrenner, and others. less direct in the earlier period are the influences of polish folk music and of italian opera. much of what became his typical style of ornamentation ( for example, his fioriture ) is taken from singing. his melodic lines were increasingly reminiscent of the modes and features of the music of his native country, such as drones.',\n",
       " '5_56': 'chopin took the new salon genre of the nocturne, invented by the irish composer john field, to a deeper level of sophistication. he was the first to write ballades and scherzi as individual concert pieces. he essentially established a new genre with his own set of free - standing preludes ( op. 28, published 1839 ). he exploited the poetic potential of the concept of the concert etude, already being developed in the 1820s and 1830s by liszt, clementi and moscheles, in his two sets of studies ( op. 10 published in 1833, op. 25 in 1837 ).',\n",
       " '5_57': 'chopin also endowed popular dance forms with a greater range of melody and expression. chopin\\'s mazurkas, while originating in the traditional polish dance ( the mazurek ), differed from the traditional variety in that they were written for the concert hall rather than the dance hall ; \" it was chopin who put the mazurka on the european musical map. \" the series of seven polonaises published in his lifetime ( another nine were published posthumously ), beginning with the op. 26 pair ( published 1836 ), set a new standard for music in the form. his waltzes were also written specifically for the salon recital rather than the ballroom and are frequently at rather faster tempos than their dance - floor equivalents.',\n",
       " '5_58': \"some of chopin's well - known pieces have acquired descriptive titles, such as the revolutionary etude ( op. 10, no. 12 ), and the minute waltz ( op. 64, no. 1 ). however, with the exception of his funeral march, the composer never named an instrumental work beyond genre and number, leaving all potential extramusical associations to the listener ; the names by which many of his pieces are known were invented by others. there is no evidence to suggest that the revolutionary etude was written with the failed polish uprising against russia in mind ; it merely appeared at that time. the funeral march, the third movement of his sonata no. 2 ( op. 35 ), the one case where he did give a title, was written before the rest of the sonata, but no specific event or death is known to have inspired it.\",\n",
       " '5_59': \"the last opus number that chopin himself used was 65, allocated to the cello sonata in g minor. he expressed a deathbed wish that all his unpublished manuscripts be destroyed. at the request of the composer's mother and sisters, however, his musical executor julian fontana selected 23 unpublished piano pieces and grouped them into eight further opus numbers ( opp. 66 – 73 ), published in 1855. in 1857, 17 polish songs that chopin wrote at various stages of his life were collected and published as op. 74, though their order within the opus did not reflect the order of composition.\",\n",

       " '5_65': \"chopin's polonaises show a marked advance on those of his polish predecessors in the form ( who included his teachers zywny and elsner ). as with the traditional polonaise, chopin's works are in triple time and typically display a martial rhythm in their melodies, accompaniments and cadences. unlike most of their precursors, they also require a formidable playing technique.\",\n",
       " '5_66': 'the 21 nocturnes are more structured, and of greater emotional depth, than those of field ( whom chopin met in 1833 ). many of the chopin nocturnes have middle sections marked by agitated expression ( and often making very difficult demands on the performer ) which heightens their dramatic character.',\n",
       " '5_67': \"chopin's etudes are largely in straightforward ternary form. he used them to teach his own technique of piano playing — for instance playing double thirds ( op. 25, no. 6 ), playing in octaves ( op. 25, no. 10 ), and playing repeated notes ( op. 10, no. 7 ).\",\n",

       " '5_69': 'the two mature piano sonatas ( no. 2, op. 35, written in 1839 and no. 3, op. 58, written in 1844 ) are in four movements. in op. 35, chopin was able to combine within a formal large musical structure many elements of his virtuosic piano technique — \" a kind of dialogue between the public pianism of the brilliant style and the german sonata principle \". the last movement, a brief ( 75 - bar ) perpetuum mobile in which the hands play in unmodified octave unison throughout, was found shocking and unmusical by contemporaries, including schumann. the op. 58 sonata is closer to the german tradition, including many passages of complex counterpoint, \" worthy of brahms \" according to the music historians kornel michałowski and jim samson.',\n",
       " '5_70': 'chopin\\'s harmonic innovations may have arisen partly from his keyboard improvisation technique. temperley says that in his works \" novel harmonic effects frequently result from the combination of ordinary appoggiaturas or passing notes with melodic figures of accompaniment \", and cadences are delayed by the use of chords outside the home key ( neapolitan sixths and diminished sevenths ), or by sudden shifts to remote keys. chord progressions sometimes anticipate the shifting tonality of later composers such as claude debussy, as does chopin\\'s use of modal harmony.',\n",
       " '5_71': 'in 1841, leon escudier wrote of a recital given by chopin that year, \" one may say that chopin is the creator of a school of piano and a school of composition. in truth, nothing equals the lightness, the sweetness with which the composer preludes on the piano ; moreover nothing may be compared to his works full of originality, distinction and grace. \" chopin refused to conform to a standard method of playing and believed that there was no set technique for playing well. his style was based extensively on his use of very independent finger technique. in his projet de methode he wrote : \" everything is a matter of knowing good fingering... we need no less to use the rest of the hand, the wrist, the forearm and the upper arm. \" he further stated : \" one needs only to study a certain position of the hand in relation to the keys to obtain with ease the most beautiful quality of sound, to know how to play short notes and long notes, and [ to attain ] unlimited dexterity. \" the consequences of this approach to technique in chopin\\'s music include the frequent use of the entire range of the keyboard, passages in double octaves and other chord groupings, swiftly repeated notes, the use of grace notes, and the use of contrasting rhythms ( four against three, for example ) between the hands.',\n",

       " '5_73': 'jonathan bellman writes that modern concert performance style — set in the \" conservatory \" tradition of late 19th - and 20th - century music schools, and suitable for large auditoria or recordings — militates against what is known of chopin\\'s more intimate performance technique. the composer himself said to a pupil that \" concerts are never real music, you have to give up the idea of hearing in them all the most beautiful things of art. \" contemporary accounts indicate that in performance, chopin avoided rigid procedures sometimes incorrectly attributed to him, such as \" always crescendo to a high note \", but that he was concerned with expressive phrasing, rhythmic consistency and sensitive colouring. berlioz wrote in 1853 that chopin \" has created a kind of chromatic embroidery... whose effect is so strange and piquant as to be impossible to describe... virtually nobody but chopin himself can play this music and give it this unusual turn \". hiller wrote that \" what in the hands of others was elegant embellishment, in his hands became a colourful wreath of flowers. \"',\n",
       " '5_74': 'chopin\\'s music is frequently played with rubato, \" the practice in performance of disregarding strict time,\\'robbing\\'some note - values for expressive effect \". there are differing opinions as to how much, and what type, of rubato is appropriate for his works. charles rosen comments that \" most of the written - out indications of rubato in chopin are to be found in his mazurkas... it is probable that chopin used the older form of rubato so important to mozart... [ where ] the melody note in the right hand is delayed until after the note in the bass... an allied form of this rubato is the arpeggiation of the chords thereby delaying the melody note ; according to chopin\\'s pupil, karol mikuli, chopin was firmly opposed to this practice. \"',\n",
       " '5_75': 'friederike muller, a pupil of chopin, wrote : \" [ his ] playing was always noble and beautiful ; his tones sang, whether in full forte or softest piano. he took infinite pains to teach his pupils this legato, cantabile style of playing. his most severe criticism was\\'he — or she — does not know how to join two notes together.\\'he also demanded the strictest adherence to rhythm. he hated all lingering and dragging, misplaced rubatos, as well as exaggerated ritardandos... and it is precisely in this respect that people make such terrible errors in playing his works. \"',\n",
       " '5_76': 'with his mazurkas and polonaises, chopin has been credited with introducing to music a new sense of nationalism. schumann, in his 1836 review of the piano concertos, highlighted the composer\\'s strong feelings for his native poland, writing that \" now that the poles are in deep mourning [ after the failure of the november 1830 rising ], their appeal to us artists is even stronger... if the mighty autocrat in the north [ i. e. nicholas i of russia ] could know that in chopin\\'s works, in the simple strains of his mazurkas, there lurks a dangerous enemy, he would place a ban on his music. chopin\\'s works are cannon buried in flowers! \" the biography of chopin published in 1863 under the name of franz liszt ( but probably written by carolyne zu sayn - wittgenstein ) claims that chopin \" must be ranked first among the first musicians... individualizing in themselves the poetic sense of an entire nation. \"',\n",
       " '5_77': 'some modern commentators have argued against exaggerating chopin\\'s primacy as a \" nationalist \" or \" patriotic \" composer. george golos refers to earlier \" nationalist \" composers in central europe, including poland\\'s michał kleofas oginski and franciszek lessel, who utilised polonaise and mazurka forms. barbara milewski suggests that chopin\\'s experience of polish music came more from \" urbanised \" warsaw versions than from folk music, and that attempts ( by jachimecki and others ) to demonstrate genuine folk music in his works are without basis. richard taruskin impugns schumann\\'s attitude toward chopin\\'s works as patronizing and comments that chopin \" felt his polish patriotism deeply and sincerely \" but consciously modelled his works on the tradition of bach, beethoven, schubert and field.',\n",
       " '5_78': 'a reconciliation of these views is suggested by william atwood : \" undoubtedly [ chopin\\'s ] use of traditional musical forms like the polonaise and mazurka roused nationalistic sentiments and a sense of cohesiveness amongst those poles scattered across europe and the new world... while some sought solace in [ them ], others found them a source of strength in their continuing struggle for freedom. although chopin\\'s music undoubtedly came to him intuitively rather than through any conscious patriotic design, it served all the same to symbolize the will of the polish people... \"',\n",
       " '5_79': 'jones comments that \" chopin\\'s unique position as a composer, despite the fact that virtually everything he wrote was for the piano, has rarely been questioned. \" he also notes that chopin was fortunate to arrive in paris in 1831 — \" the artistic environment, the publishers who were willing to print his music, the wealthy and aristocratic who paid what chopin asked for their lessons \" — and these factors, as well as his musical genius, also fuelled his contemporary and later reputation. while his illness and his love - affairs conform to some of the stereotypes of romanticism, the rarity of his public recitals ( as opposed to performances at fashionable paris soirees ) led arthur hutchings to suggest that \" his lack of byronic flamboyance [ and ] his aristocratic reclusiveness make him exceptional \" among his romantic contemporaries, such as liszt and henri herz.',\n",
       " '5_80': \"chopin's qualities as a pianist and composer were recognized by many of his fellow musicians. schumann named a piece for him in his suite carnaval, and chopin later dedicated his ballade no. 2 in f major to schumann. elements of chopin's music can be traced in many of liszt's later works. liszt later transcribed for piano six of chopin's polish songs. a less fraught friendship was with alkan, with whom he discussed elements of folk music, and who was deeply affected by chopin's death.\",\n",

       " '8_14': \"in 2003, nintendo announced that a new the legend of zelda game was in the works for the gamecube by the same team that had created the cel - shaded the wind waker. at the following year's game developers conference, director eiji aonuma unintentionally revealed that the game's sequel was in development under the working title the wind waker 2 ; it was set to use a similar graphical style to that of its predecessor. nintendo of america told aonuma that north american sales of the wind waker were sluggish because its cartoon appearance created the impression that the game was designed for a young audience. concerned that the sequel would have the same problem, aonuma expressed to producer shigeru miyamoto that he wanted to create a realistic zelda game that would appeal to the north american market. miyamoto, hesitant about solely changing the game's presentation, suggested the team's focus should instead be on coming up with gameplay innovations. he advised that aonuma should start by doing what could not be done in ocarina of time, particularly horseback combat. [ l ]\",\n",
       " '8_15': \"in four months, aonuma's team managed to present realistic horseback riding, [ l ] which nintendo later revealed to the public with a trailer at electronic entertainment expo 2004. the game was scheduled to be released the next year, and was no longer a follow - up to the wind waker ; a true sequel to it was released for the nintendo ds in 2007, in the form of phantom hourglass. miyamoto explained in interviews that the graphical style was chosen to satisfy demand, and that it better fit the theme of an older incarnation of link. the game runs on a modified the wind waker engine.\",\n",
       " '8_16': 'prior zelda games have employed a theme of two separate, yet connected, worlds. in a link to the past, link travels between a \" light world \" and a \" dark world \" ; in ocarina of time, as well as in oracle of ages, link travels between two different time periods. the zelda team sought to reuse this motif in the series\\'latest installment. it was suggested that link transform into a wolf, much like he metamorphoses into a rabbit in the dark world of a link to the past. [ m ] the story of the game was created by aonuma, and later underwent several changes by scenario writers mitsuhiro takano and aya kyogoku. takano created the script for the story scenes, while kyogoku and takayuki ikkaku handled the actual in - game script. aonuma left his team working on the new idea while he directed the minish cap for the game boy advance. when he returned, he found the twilight princess team struggling. emphasis on the parallel worlds and the wolf transformation had made link\\'s character unbelievable. aonuma also felt the gameplay lacked the caliber of innovation found in phantom hourglass, which was being developed with touch controls for the nintendo ds. at the same time, the wii was under development with the code name \" revolution \". miyamoto thought that the revolution\\'s pointing device, the wii remote, was well suited for aiming arrows in zelda, and suggested that aonuma consider using it.

       " '8_17': 'aonuma had anticipated creating a zelda game for what would later be called the wii, but had assumed that he would need to complete twilight princess first. his team began work developing a pointing - based interface for the bow and arrow, and aonuma found that aiming directly at the screen gave the game a new feel, just like the ds control scheme for phantom hourglass. aonuma felt confident this was the only way to proceed, but worried about consumers who had been anticipating a gamecube release. developing two versions would mean delaying the previously announced 2005 release, still disappointing the consumer. satoru iwata felt that having both versions would satisfy users in the end, even though they would have to wait for the finished product. aonuma then started working on both versions in parallel. [ o ]',\n",

[ o ] at e3 2005, nintendo released a small number of nintendo ds game cards containing a preview trailer for twilight princess. they also announced that zelda would appear on the wii ( then codenamed \" revolution \" ), but it was not clear to the media if this meant twilight princess or a different game.',\n",
       " '8_19': \"the team worked on a wii control scheme, adapting camera control and the fighting mechanics to the new interface. a prototype was created that used a swinging gesture to control the sword from a first - person viewpoint, but was unable to show the variety of link's movements. when the third - person view was restored, aonuma thought it felt strange to swing the wii remote with the right hand to control the sword in link's left hand, so the entire wii version map was mirrored. [ p ] details about wii controls began to surface in december 2005 when british publication ngc magazine claimed that when a gamecube copy of twilight princess was played on the revolution, it would give the player the option of using the revolution controller. miyamoto confirmed the revolution controller - functionality in an interview with nintendo of europe and time reported this soon after. however, support for the wii controller did not make it into the gamecube release. at e3 2006, nintendo announced that both versions would be available at the wii launch, and had a playable version of twilight princess for the wii.

[ q ] the camera movement was reworked and item controls were changed to avoid accidental button presses. [ r ] in addition, the new item system required use of the button that had previously been used for the sword. to solve this, sword controls were transferred back to gestures — something e3 attendees had commented they would like to see. this reintroduced the problem of using a right - handed swing to control a left - handed sword attack. the team did not have enough time before release to rework link\\'s character model, so they instead flipped the entire game — everything was made a mirror image. [ s ] link was now right - handed, and references to \" east \" and \" west \" were switched around. the gamecube version, however, was left with the original orientation. the twilight princess player\\'s guide focuses on the wii version, but has a section in the back with mirror - image maps for gamecube users.

       " '12_21': 'scholar patrick chura, who suggests emmett till was a model for tom robinson, enumerates the injustices endured by the fictional tom that till also faced. chura notes the icon of the black rapist causing harm to the representation of the \" mythologized vulnerable and sacred southern womanhood \". any transgressions by black males that merely hinted at sexual contact with white females during the time the novel was set often resulted in a punishment of death for the accused. tom robinson\\'s trial was juried by poor white farmers who convicted him despite overwhelming evidence of his innocence, as more educated and moderate white townspeople supported the jury\\'s decision. furthermore, the victim of racial injustice in to kill a mockingbird was physically impaired, which made him unable to commit the act he was accused of, but also crippled him in other ways. roslyn siegel includes tom robinson as an example of the recurring motif among white southern writers of the black man as \" stupid, pathetic, defenseless, and dependent upon the fair dealing of the whites, rather than his own intelligence to save him \". although tom is spared from being lynched, he is killed with excessive violence during an attempted escape from prison, shot seventeen times.',\n",
       " '12_22': 'the theme of racial injustice appears symbolically in the novel as well. for example, atticus must shoot a rabid dog, even though it is not his job to do so. carolyn jones argues that the dog represents prejudice within the town of maycomb, and atticus, who waits on a deserted street to shoot the dog, must fight against the town\\'s racism without help from other white citizens. he is also alone when he faces a group intending to lynch tom robinson and once more in the courthouse during tom\\'s trial. lee even uses dreamlike imagery from the mad dog incident to describe some of the courtroom scenes. jones writes, \" [ t ] he real mad dog in maycomb is the racism that denies the humanity of tom robinson.... when atticus makes his summation to the jury, he literally bares himself to the jury\\'s and the town\\'s anger. \"',\n",
       " '12_23': 'in a 1964 interview, lee remarked that her aspiration was \" to be... the jane austen of south alabama. \" both austen and lee challenged the social status quo and valued individual worth over social standing. when scout embarrasses her poorer classmate, walter cunningham, at the finch home one day, calpurnia, their black cook, chastises and punishes her for doing so. atticus respects calpurnia\\'s judgment, and later in the book even stands up to his sister, the formidable aunt alexandra, when she strongly suggests they fire calpurnia. one writer notes that scout, \" in austenian fashion \", satirizes women with whom she does not wish to identify. literary critic jean blackall lists the priorities shared by the two authors : \" affirmation of order in society, obedience, courtesy, and respect for the individual without regard for status \".',\n",
       " '12_24': 'scholars argue that lee\\'s approach to class and race was more complex \" than ascribing racial prejudice primarily to\\'poor white trash \\'... lee demonstrates how issues of gender and class intensify prejudice, silence the voices that might challenge the existing order, and greatly complicate many americans\\'conception of the causes of racism and segregation. \" lee\\'s use of the middle - class narrative voice is a literary device that allows an intimacy with the reader, regardless of class or cultural background, and fosters a sense of nostalgia. sharing scout and jem\\'s perspective, the reader is allowed to engage in relationships with the conservative antebellum mrs. dubose ; the lower - class ewells, and the cunninghams who are equally poor but behave in vastly different ways ; the wealthy but ostracized mr. dolphus raymond ; and calpurnia and other members of the black community. the children internalize atticus\\'admonition not to judge someone until they have walked around in that person\\'s skin, gaining a greater understanding of people\\'s motives and behavior.',\n",
       " '12_25': 'the novel has been noted for its poignant exploration of different forms of courage. scout\\'s impulsive inclination to fight students who insult atticus reflects her attempt to stand up for him and defend him. atticus is the moral center of the novel, however, and he teaches jem one of the most significant lessons of courage. in a statement that foreshadows atticus\\'motivation for defending tom robinson and describes mrs. dubose, who is determined to break herself of a morphine addiction, atticus tells jem that courage is \" when you\\'re licked before you begin but you begin anyway and you see it through no matter what \".',\n",
       " '12_26': 'charles shields, who has written the only book - length biography of harper lee to date, offers the reason for the novel\\'s enduring popularity and impact is that \" its lessons of human dignity and respect for others remain fundamental and universal \". atticus\\'lesson to scout that \" you never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view — until you climb around in his skin and walk around in it \" exemplifies his compassion. she ponders the comment when listening to mayella ewell\\'s testimony. when mayella reacts with confusion to atticus\\'question if she has any friends, scout offers that she must be lonelier than boo radley. having walked boo home after he saves their lives, scout stands on the radley porch and considers the events of the previous three years from boo\\'s perspective. one writer remarks, \"... [ w ] hile the novel concerns tragedy and injustice, heartache and loss, it also carries with it a strong sense [ of ] courage, compassion, and an awareness of history to be better human beings. \"',\n",
       " '12_27': 'just as lee explores jem\\'s development in coming to grips with a racist and unjust society, scout realizes what being female means, and several female characters influence her development. scout\\'s primary identification with her father and older brother allows her to describe the variety and depth of female characters in the novel both as one of them and as an outsider. scout\\'s primary female models are calpurnia and her neighbor miss maudie, both of whom are strong willed, independent, and protective. mayella ewell also has an influence ; scout watches her destroy an innocent man in order to hide her desire for him. the female characters who comment the most on scout\\'s lack of willingness to adhere to a more feminine role are also those who promote the most racist and classist points of view. for example, mrs. dubose chastises scout for not wearing a dress and camisole, and indicates she is ruining the family name by not doing so, in addition to insulting atticus\\'intentions to defend tom robinson. by balancing the masculine influences of atticus and jem with the feminine influences of calpurnia and miss maudie, one scholar writes, \" lee gradually demonstrates that scout is becoming a feminist in the south, for with the use of first - person narration, she indicates that scout / jean louise still maintains the ambivalence about being a southern lady she possessed as a child. \"',\n",
       " '12_28': 'absent mothers and abusive fathers are another theme in the novel. scout and jem\\'s mother died before scout could remember her, mayella\\'s mother is dead, and mrs. radley is silent about boo\\'s confinement to the house. apart from atticus, the fathers described are abusers. bob ewell, it is hinted, molested his daughter, and mr. radley imprisons his son in his house until boo is remembered only as a phantom. bob ewell and mr. radley represent a form of masculinity that atticus does not, and the novel suggests that such men as well as the traditionally feminine hypocrites at the missionary society can lead society astray. atticus stands apart as a unique model of masculinity ; as one scholar explains : \" it is the job of real men who embody the traditional masculine qualities of heroic individualism, bravery, and an unshrinking knowledge of and dedication to social justice and morality, to set the society straight. \"',\n",
       " '12_29': 'allusions to legal issues in to kill a mockingbird, particularly in scenes outside of the courtroom, has drawn the attention from legal scholars. claudia durst johnson writes that \" a greater volume of critical readings has been amassed by two legal scholars in law journals than by all the literary scholars in literary journals \". the opening quote by the 19th - century essayist charles lamb reads : \" lawyers, i suppose, were children once. \" johnson notes that even in scout and jem\\'s childhood world, compromises and treaties are struck with each other by spitting on one\\'s palm and laws are discussed by atticus and his children : is it right that bob ewell hunts and traps out of season? many social codes are broken by people in symbolic courtrooms : mr. dolphus raymond has been exiled by society for taking a black woman as his common - law wife and having interracial children ; mayella ewell is beaten by her father in punishment for kissing tom robinson ; by being turned into a non - person, boo radley receives a punishment far greater than any court could have given him. scout repeatedly breaks codes and laws and reacts to her punishment for them. for example, she refuses to wear frilly clothes, saying that aunt alexandra\\'s \" fanatical \" attempts to place her in them made her feel \" a pink cotton penitentiary closing in on [ her ] \". johnson states, \" [ t ] he novel is a study of how jem and scout begin to perceive the complexity of social codes and how the configuration of relationships dictated by or set off by those codes fails or nurtures the inhabitants of ( their ) small worlds. \"',\n",
       " '12_30': 'songbirds and their associated symbolism appear throughout the novel. the family\\'s last name of finch also shares lee\\'s mother\\'s maiden name. the titular mockingbird is a key motif of this theme, which first appears when atticus, having given his children air - rifles for christmas, allows their uncle jack to teach them to shoot. atticus warns them that, although they can \" shoot all the bluejays they want \", they must remember that \" it\\'s a sin to kill a mockingbird \". confused, scout approaches her neighbor miss maudie, who explains that mockingbirds never harm other living creatures. she points out that mockingbirds simply provide pleasure with their songs, saying, \" they don\\'t do one thing but sing their hearts out for us. \" writer edwin bruell summarized the symbolism when he wrote in 1964, \"\\'to kill a mockingbird\\'is to kill that which is innocent and harmless — like tom robinson. \" scholars have noted that lee often returns to the mockingbird theme when trying to make a moral point.',\n",

Next to the Main Building is the Basilica of the Sacred Heart. Immediately behind the basilica is the Grotto, a Marian place of prayer and reflection. It is a replica of the grotto at Lourdes, France where the Virgin Mary reputedly appeared to Saint Bernadette Soubirous in 1858. At the end of the main drive (and in a direct line that connects through 3 statues and the Gold Dome), is a simple, modern stone statue of Mary.\n"
